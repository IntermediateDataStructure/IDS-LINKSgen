Since 13 January 2025, the IDS maintains the most recent version of the script.

This script was written to transform LINKS-IDS into LINKS-gen, as discussed in https://doi.org/10.51964/hlcs9310

The script has not been tested on other IDS datasets, but is IDS-compliant and should -in theory- work.

LINKS-gen and the concomittant script were written by https://github.com/RJMourits/IDS-LINKSgen as part of the Genes, Germs, and Resources project supported by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) [360-53-180].
